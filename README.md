## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans. It's called general purpose dynamic language because it is not written in machine readable language and it's easy for humans to understand that is why it is high-level programming language.     

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans. type of the variable is determined only during runtime that is why it is dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans. Pros:                                       Cons:
1.Python is easy to learn and read               1.It can have runtime errors 
2.It is open source language                     2.It consumes a lot of memory space
3.It has vast collection of libraries            3. Due to consumption of lot memory space it is not good for mobile computing
4.It is an interpreted language

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans. 1.Artificial intelligence
     2. Data analytics and data visualization
     3.Web development
     4. Graphical User Interface
     5. mobile app development

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans. Value that can change, We can assign value depending upon the conditions. Variable consists of a data type
