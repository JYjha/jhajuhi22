# Assignment Part - II
Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans.A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes are string.
Example: 'This is a string' or "123".

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
Ans. String can be assessed using sting name or variable assigned to it and index number.
Example: 
x = 'Juhi'
print(x[0])
#output will be J. because index starts with 0th position.

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"   
Ans. 
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(len(string))
print(string[9:16])
print(string.index("iNeuron"))
```
Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "norueNi"
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(len(string))
x= string[9:16]
print(x)
print(x[::-1])

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.
Ans. 
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
print(string[::-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
Ans. 
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
del string


Q32. What is escape sequence?
Ans. backslash (\)" character as an escape character. The sequence of character after backslash are called escape sequence characters.
Example: \t, \n, \b ,\",\'

Q33. How can you print the below string?

'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

Ans. 
str = '''iNeuron's Big Data Course'''
print('''\'iNeuron's Big Data Course\'''')

Q34. What is a list in Python?
Ans. Lists are used to store multiple items or collection of data in a single variable.
it is a sequencial data type.
Example: list1 = ["Apple", "oranges", "Grapes"]
         list2 = ["Ridhi", 12, Sagar, 18]

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
Ans. We can create python list just by placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].
Example: we can also create empty list and add values later.
list0 = [] #empty list
list1 = [5,10,15]

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
Ans. We can access elements by providing index number of the elements.
Example:
list1 = [5,10,15]
print(list1[0]) 
# output will be 5 because 5 is at 0th position in the given list

Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
Ans. 
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(lst[4][2])

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
Ans. 
lst = []
lst.append(12)
lst.append(24)
lst.append(36)
print(len(lst)
#output will be 3

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
Ans.
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(2,"Big")
print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Ans. Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
      tuples are immutable but list are mutable.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
Ans. A tuple in Python can be created by enclosing all the comma-separated elements inside the parenthesis ().
example: tup1 = (1,2,3)
         tup2 = ("Big","Data", "ineuron")

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
Ans. t1 = ("Ridhi", "Rashmi",)
No, We can't add our name to tuple because it is immutable.

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
Ans. tup1 = ("x", "y" ,"z")
     tup2 = (1, 2, 3)
     tup3 = tup1 + tup2
     print(tup3)

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
Ans. t1 = ('x', 'y', 'z', 1, 2, 3)
     print(len(t1))

Q45. What are sets in Python?
Ans. A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
     It is enclosed in curly braces {}.

Q46. How can you create a set?
Ans. We can create set by placing elements in the  {} braces with comma separated or we can use in-built set() function.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set
Ans. set1 = {"x","y",}
     set1.add("iNeuron")
     print(set1)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Ans. set1 = {"x","y",}
     set1.add("iNeuron")
     set1.add("Big")
     set1.add("Data")
     print(set1)

Q49. How is update() different from add()
Ans. add() is used to add one element in a set and update is used to add another set or list in the existing set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
Ans. The clear() method removes all elements in a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
Ans. Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
Ans. Set is mutable and frozen set is immutable.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans. Combining two sets by using union().
     set1 = {1,2,3}
     set2 = {"is","are","am"}
     print(set1 | set2)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans. common values of two sets are fetched using intersection()
     set1 = {1,2,3,"is"}
     set2 = {"is","are","am",1,5}
     print(set1 & set2)
