# Assignment Part - II
Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans.A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes are string.
Example: 'This is a string' or "123".

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
Ans. String can be assessed using sting name or variable assigned to it and index number.
Example: 
x = 'Juhi'
print(x[0])
#output will be J. because index starts with 0th position.

Ans. A for loop is a single-line command that will be executed repeatedly. While loops can be single-lined or contain multiple commands for a single condition.

Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
Ans.The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
Example: 
      if num>500:
#         break
#     elif num>150:
#         continue
#     elif num % 5 == 0:
#         print(num)

refer above example.

Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
Ans. Python pass is a null statement provided by the Python programming language in order to ignore a set of code that we do not want to execute.

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
Ans. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
Syntax: range(start, stop, step)

Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
Ans. We can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop. We can use the keys(), items(), and values() methods.
